         <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name, as you may already know is Gabriel Young. You can call me Gabe! Right now, I am attending the UNC Coding Bootcamp in my home state of North Carolina. Coding is very new to me but I am doing my best to learn everything I can. On this site you'll be able to find a list of all my projects, past and present as well as a way to contact me. </p>
         <p>    I'll try and think of a few interesting things to say about myself. I was born in Pittsburgh PA but quickly moved to North Carolina. I have a passion for film making and story telling. In fact I attend Emerson College in Boston MA persuing a major in Video & Media Arts with a minor in Photography. While taking time off from Emerson I decided to attend the UNC Coding Bootcamp to aquire a new understand of web design and coding. 
         </p>
         <p> So far it has been difficult but rewarding process. I find that while coding and styling at first seems mysterious it is consistently logical. This makes it easy to get creative with the code which wasn't something I had expected to enjoy so much. </p>
