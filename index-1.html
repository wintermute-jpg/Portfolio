         <p>Hello and welcome to my portfolio! My name, as you may already know is Gabriel Young. You can call me Gabe! Right now this is just a bunch of place holder text but one day this'll all be about how great I am. Thanks for reading!</p>
         <p>    I'll try and think of a few interesting things to say about myself. I was born in Pittsburgh PA but quickly moved to North Carolina. I have a passion for film making and story telling. I'm very new to coding but thanks to UNC Coding Bootcamp I'm well on my way to figuring it all out. Its still rather confusing as I'm sure you can tell by the lack luster style of this page.</p>
         <p>Oh yeah. I guess I should adress the image huh. It goes without saying that that isn't me. Its Dio! The baddest mofo on the planet. Guy came back to life like three times. Got his head chopped off and transplanted it onto a new body. How wild is that. Anyways I just thought it would be a funny place holder image until I finally found a picture of myself thats accurate. You see I recently shaved my head. So all the photos I have of myself aren't exactly up to date.</p>
         <p>Don't worry though, I'm not going postal. Truth is I just got self concious of my hair. It was really long and I kept fussing over it. I was also worried I was going bad. Spoiler, I wasn't. Anyway it was a bit of a split second decision but one night I just shaved it all off. I've been rocking the look ever since. Still don't have any cool pics unfortunately.</p>
