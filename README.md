# Portfolio
Repo for HW#1

This repo stores my first homework assignment for the UNC Coding Bootcamp. It is a rough Portfolio containing basic information about me as well as how to contact me. In the future it will hold links to my other major projects made for the course. It is an easy way to eyeball my personality and skill with HTML and CSS.
